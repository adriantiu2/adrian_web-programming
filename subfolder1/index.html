					<p>How has everything this year been for you in terms of  creative flow? </p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>I mean, it’s been cool. It’s just kind of made me slow down, but in a good way. Like, I’m just on some not forcing shit. I feel like everyone was trying to be like, “Oh, I got to be more productive.”. I think it was the opposite. I think it was a time to go inward and take time for yourself. Being creative doesn’t mean you always got to be producing. I feel like if you get yourself right you’ll have an easier time.</p>

					<p>Where did you grow up? What was your family like?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>I grew up in Portland, Oregon. My family—they’re not really artistic. My dad is an engineer. My mom is a philanthropist. She works for nonprofit organizations and helps in raising money for different causes. And so they weren’t really on the art like that, but they were big on culture. So we would travel a lot and they would always try to put me on to black culture. So just trying to teach me where I came from.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>So how would you say you got into the art scene? Or when did you see yourself start becoming interested in art?</p>

				<div class="answer">

					<p>As a kid I’ve always been into drawing and making stuff, I just never took it seriously. I never thought I was good enough. I remember going to this program and then we passed this dude on a computer. And he takes this weight lifting dude and he puts some words on it. It was like the weightlifting dude was holding the words. And I was just like, “What the fuck is that?”. And they were like, “It’s called graphic design.”. And I was like, “That is so sick.”. Then, towards the end of high school, I started getting more into graphics because I was taking art classes and I just liked fucking around on the computer. And then I wanted to make t-shirts. I wanted to make a brand or something. I just remember a lot of niggas was like, “Bro, you don’t know nothing about fashion you can’t make no brand.”. I’m not a contrarian or anything, but if someone says I can’t do something, it motivates me. So, I just started doing it more and I sucked at first but I just kept making shit and soon people just knew me for making stuff. </p>
					<p>Then I met this homie in college and he was making tees and he was like, “Bro, you’re shit’s cool! Keep it going.” and I was like, “Keep it going until what?”. He was like, “It’s called graphic design. You can make your own brand. Like this is what people really do.”. Then he showed me how he was silkscreening in his room in college. I had never seen someone print before, so that’s probably what really ignited it. My homies—they had a brand in California and they were like, “if you come here and silkscreen our stuff, we’ll let you still screen your own stuff.”. So I moved there and then a few years later is probably when I actually started getting into the art scene and mixing with a lot of kids who went to fine art school. That’s when people would be like, “Graphic design isn’t an art.”. And I’d be like, “I don’t know. Maybe it’s not fine art, but these tees that we are making—this is art. And this is before Braindead or any of these brands that push art first. I mean, nowadays, you get a lot of fine artists starting clothing brands, so it’s interesting.<p>

					<p>What’s your opinion on the streetwear scene as of now, if that’s how you would classify it?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<figure>
						<img src="assets/ice.png" alt="comingforice" class="photo"/>
							<figcaption>“Coming For Your Ice” zine by Full Court Press, 2017.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>I mean, I’m glad that there’s so many more kids involved. It’s a beautiful thing, you know. I just kind of have a purist perspective, which I’m starting to let go of more. I come from a place where if you’re into something, you couldn’t just claim it on the internet. You had to like, go outside and meet people. Like, the only way that you could be a part of a scene was because you were actually in the scene. Like you had to actually be at the art shows or you had to make friends with the buyers at the stores. You had to actually get kids to wear it outside. So, that is the part that I kind of miss: just the authenticity. These days, as long as you get the right person in it and you get the right influencers behind it, it’s gonna take off. Before, you almost had to take more risk, you had to believe in it. That being said, I like the creativity right now. I see a lot of kids getting exposure, which is cool. It’s a saturated market, but I’m appreciative. It’s kind of like rap; I like Future, but I like Nas too. <p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Yeah. No, I agree. I feel like, yes, there’s the influencer aspect, but I still think you got to approach it the same way as you did in 2001. You can get these influencers, but there’s gonna be people that can see the disingenuity if you’re not outside, you know?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Exactly. And that’s how I kind of do it with <em>Full Court</em>. A lot of people were like, “Yo, you should do like this, you should do it like that”, but I kind of just let the shirt speak for itself. And if you like it, you like it. If you don’t, it’s alright. You can keep scrolling. And it kind of worked. I didn’t expect it to work like that, because that wasn’t like a marketing strategy or anything like that. It was just how I felt at the time. Everyone was trying to come up with gimmicks to get people to pay attention and I was just like, “Fuck that”. Like, I care about the graphics. If the graphic is tight then people will want to buy it. I got some friends who are chill people, but I’ve never reached out to them like, “Yo, could you wear my shirt?”. Anyone that I post on <em>Full Court</em> that’s wearing it—I actually know them. And just trying—this might sound too noble or something—but just trying to bring back a little bit of authenticity. <p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Yeah, that’s why I appreciate the brand. You decided on this aesthetic and you’ve run with it. </p>

				</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>At first it wasn’t conscious. The reason for the black and white tees is because those are the most basic tees that you could use. A lot of people see it as like limitations, but for me, I see that as an opportunity. I had a dude, just tell me like, “Yo, if it looks good in one color, it’ll look good in seven colors.”. So I always try to make something as simple as it can be. And then if we need to, we can add more to it. But if you can make a one color graphic look sick...I mean, that’s the essence of silkscreen. Because it’s not going to cost you a lot of money. And so it’s almost like a high school...like an art project. Like, I don’t really know how to silkscreen, but I’m gonna make this one color shirt and hopefully it hits. And so that along with, like, the vibe—I wanted it to feel like a thrift. Like, if you found it in a thrift store, you’d be like, “Yo, this is the hardest shirt ever.”.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Yeah, for sure. I feel like <em>Full Court Press</em> is very self aware. Self aware of the culture it represents and self aware of its materiality. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>For sure. I’m not the oldest, but I’m not the youngest. So it’s just about where we fit in in this conversation of graphic t-shirts, you know? I saw what people did before me and then I saw what people were doing at the time. And when I started making it, I felt like people were forgetting the heritage of this art form a little bit. I don’t want to preach about it, but if you look at it, you’ll start to see, like, “Oh, this person was doing this on purpose.”, you know?<p>

            	<div class="question">
					<p>What kinds of typography are most interested in or take most inspiration from?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>My favorite type of shit is a person who’s not an artist who has to be an artist. Like when you go to these little mom and pop stores where they painted the sign. They had to just paint it because they needed a sign, you know. That’s what I really like, whether it’s letters or figures or anything. I just like that looseness and just like the creativity of it. And just anything a little bit off and with a human touch to it. Even a good painter. You can feel it, someone painted it and it wasn’t digital, you know. Just that human aspect. Not to be too cheesy, but like that Wabi Sabi and that imperfection.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>No, I totally agree. I look at it as a necessity as a form of design generation. Like, they needed that sign to be created but they maybe don’t have the means to hire someone. That kind of stuff is almost impossible to be disingenuous. Like, they’re not hiring a branding director, you know?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">

            	<div class="question">
					<p>How or when did you start looking at basketball as a subject to grapple with within your art?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>I mean, I’ve always thought about it, but actually paying attention to it? Probably like 2013, ‘14 somewhere around there. And then <em>Full Court Press</em> came out around ‘15, ‘16. It was just this connection to how a lot of black youth think that the only way out of the hood is drugs or basketball, you know? And so that connection to me was always strong. It was like that biggie line: “You either got a jump shot, or you slingin’ crack rock.”. That connection was always strong with me. And then the art world...there’s not that many black people into art, because they think there’s no money in it. For better or for worse. But to be honest, it’s just a bunch of white people keeping all the money. There actually is a lot of money. And that’s not the reason to get into it but I’m just saying you could make a career out of art. And then just that juxtaposition of those two worlds. Like, the sports kids and the art kids didn’t hang out. So I just liked the idea of merging those two because that was what was merged inside of me like. I’m the kind of person that got friends that would never hang out with each other. Whether you’re a nerd or you’re a fucking drug dealer. Or whether you are a professional athlete or a professional artist. Now, as you get older, these people kind of mix more, but as a kid these groups were sub groups that hung out in their own circles and I went in between a lot of those. And so I just wanted to do something that spoke to me a little bit more. I’m a black dude who was super into sports growing up and that is nostalgic for me. As I got older, I started really appreciating art and how I could merge the two.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Word. I feel like for me, basketball definitely has that nostalgia factor. And then there are the aesthetics that come with it, especially early 2000s basketball kind of culture. It lends itself really well to clothing, in my opinion. Like the typography on a basketball card. Or the way they format the sports section of the newspaper. Or the halftoning in the printables. I just feel like it all kind of connects.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>One hundred percent. Typography from sports teams—you can get a whole thing from that. It runs deep. Like sports teams representing gangs. Like people just wearing certain sports teams to represent where they’re from. I try to look at basketball from an artistic perspective. So maybe not focusing on the best players and stuff like that, but things like Shaq’s favorite album or Iverson getting his hair braided. Just little nuanced moments that people might have forgotten about, but that are kind of emotional. Like if you know them you’re like, “Oh, shit, I remember that.”. It kinda hits a chord. So yeah, I think it’s a lot of the nuance. And then the typography is huge. I did some paintings where I took off the typography and you could still tell what team it was. Just the iconography of sports in general is pretty ingrained in America.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Yeah. In regards to what you’re talking about in terms of capturing these nuanced moments like Iverson getting his hair braided or the Shaq album—I appreciate that part of <em>Full Court Press</em>; the exclusivity in terms of subject matter. Like, if you get it, you get it. And that’s not to be alienating. That’s to be specific, you know?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>That’s the old school in me. I’m not trying to big homie nobody, but if the shirt is tight and you don’t understand it, maybe it’ll get you to do some research. And then you’re like, “Oh, shoot, I didn’t even know about that!”. And now you’re more knowledgeable because of a T-shirt, which is sick.<p>
				</div>

			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>So, <em>The Good Company</em>—when did that as an idea start for you?</p>

					</figure>
					<p>We opened it in 2012. In 2011, I probably was about to open a store, but I didn’t have a name yet. Then, probably towards the end of 2011 I came up with the name and the concept as a reaction to the times. I started <em>The Good Company</em> as a place to where it was just like, we’re going to do something different. We’re not even gonna focus on, quote unquote, streetwear values like that. We’re gonna put kids on to art and give them a place to hang out and conversate. A place for the misfits and the other kids that were like me and my partner at the time. We were just trying to create something with a different, positive vibe. We felt like, at the time, people were trying to push the wrong energy. So we were just trying to flip that.<p>

			<div class="flex-second">

							<figcaption>The Good Company pocket graphic, 2017.</figcaption>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>For sure. Trial and error. We were probably too stupid to know what we didn’t know. Which was probably a gift. We just jumped in headfirst. I’m not necessarily the best at anything really, but I’ll get it done. So we got it done. And we just kept learning—I’m still learning to this day. But we got lucky, man. A lot of people will try to act like they’re all powerful and shit. But we got lucky. I knew a lot of people who are doing cool stuff, as well as my partners. And we were in the middle of something, so we were like, how can we leverage this into something? We thought, “Oh, we know this person, we know this person, it’s going to work.”. But then, as the business kept going, we figured out that’s not how business works. So we just jumped in and just didn’t quit. Nipsey always said that, “The only thing that separates me from the next guy is I didn’t quit.”. If you don’t quit, then who knows where you’re going?<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Would you classify <em>The Good Company</em> as more of an art direction job?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Yeah, for sure. I want it to be like that one hundred percent. That’s the thing about business that I learned. One of my partners used to try to design a lot of the stuff. Like, I would design twenty to forty percent, but he wanted to design eighty to sixty percent. And I was just like, “Bro, I think you should be an art director more. We should be bringing in people more. I don’t think that you’re going to ever be able to run the business like this. I feel like you want to be discovering new artists.”. I learned that I was not gonna try to be the sole designer of a project. I think, as long as you have good direction you can get stuff done. And that’s something I’ve learned; If you want to have a business, you have to be able to delegate. I learned that through experience, but then also looking at other people’s brands that I respect. Most of the people who have their brand named after them—they don’t design the stuff. So I just realized it was almost too ego involved to be like, “I’m gonna do everything.”. You don’t have to do it all. I mean, if you are the best designer then maybe that should be your role, but there are other ways to play it. Because the business side is the side that no one really talks about. That side takes up a lot of work, especially coming from a place where we’re all, quote unquote, creatives.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>Would you say you brought that mentality over to <em>Full Court Press?</em></p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>For sure. Personally, I always had that mentality because when I was young, I never felt like I was the best. And so if I’m trying to run a business, I’m gonna go try to find the best. And then I can almost Phil Jackson the situation. Like he was a good player, but he wasn’t Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird. But when he got with Jordan, you know, Jordan didn’t want to get coached by nobody else but Phil Jackson. So that’s how I kind of see myself: as a good coach. And then it doesn’t matter. As long as the team wins, I don’t need to score forty.<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-first">
            	<div class="question">
					<p>When did you start to see yourself as part of a community?</p>

						<figcaption>The Good Company collaboration with Reebok, 2017.</figcaption>
					</div>
				</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>When I was young, I’ve always just had a little bit of a focus. I always kind of knew where I was going to a certain extent. Like, I wanted to go somewhere. I just wanted to do something. So people were like, “Damn I don’t know what you bout to do, but you gonna do something.”. So I always had people around. Back then, it was just homies trying to get girls. So we all hung out. And then when I got a little bit older, it was trying to start this business. So I’ll be around people who are also trying to start a business or people who could show me how to silkscreen or something like that. And then as I got a little bit older, it started to become a community. I was like, smoking a lot of weed so people would just want to come and hang out. So, like, you come hang out to smoke and then you go, “Oh, so you have this brand too? Oh, shit!”. And at the time, I was taking a lot of photos. Then you were like, “You take photos? okay, cool.”. </p>

					<p>But I was never thinking that I was building an audience. That’s just what I did. I’ve always had decent people skills since I was a kid. Like being able to go between a bunch of circles. I was never no gangster and I was never no nerd. And I was never really a jock. And I was never an art kid either. But I had friends in all of those worlds. Like, I was the only semi nerdy kid that could go kick it with the most hood kid that beat everybody up. Or I could go kick it with the nerds and play magic cards, you know? Or I could go hang out with my art friends and just draw all day. Or I could go hang out with the hustler kids who were trying to get money to buy Jordans. I have always moved like that since I was a kid. I didn’t really fit in anywhere, but I had friends everywhere.</p>
